I'm Brian — a copywriter who's been in a long-term relationship with words (ever since I learned to put two of them together).\n\nWriting has always been how I made sense of the world. Now, it’s how I help brands sell more, connect better, and become unforgettable.\n\nI work with strategic copy — for websites, launches, emails, and anywhere a few good words can make all the difference. My goal? To make your message get read, remembered, and clicked.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who writes like a human and thinks like a strategist — that’s me."
